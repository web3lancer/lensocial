# Community Guidelines v1.0

Welcome to our community! We are building a platform for respectful, insightful, and creative conversations. To ensure a safe and positive environment for everyone, we ask that you adhere to the following guidelines.

## Our Principles

1.  **Promote Insightful Discussion:** We encourage content that is thoughtful, constructive, and adds value to the conversation.
2.  **Respect Each Other:** Disagreements are fine, but personal attacks, harassment, and hate speech are not. Treat others with empathy and respect.
3.  **Maintain Authenticity:** Be yourself. Do not impersonate others or spread misinformation.
4.  **Protect Privacy:** Do not share private information about others without their explicit consent.
5.  **Foster a Safe Environment:** We have a zero-tolerance policy for content that promotes violence, self-harm, or illegal activities.

## Prohibited Content & Behavior

The following are not permitted on our platform:

-   **Hate Speech:** Content that attacks individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or medical condition.
-   **Harassment & Bullying:** Targeted abuse, threats, or intimidation of individuals.
-   **Spam & Scams:** Deceptive or repetitive content, including fraudulent schemes and unsolicited advertising.
-   **Misinformation:** Content that is demonstrably false and has the potential to cause harm.
-   **Impersonation:** Pretending to be someone you are not.
-   **Graphic & Violent Content:** Content that is excessively gory, violent, or promotes self-harm.
-   **Illegal Activities:** Content that promotes or facilitates illegal acts.

## Enforcement

We will take action on accounts that violate these guidelines. Actions may include:

We rely on our community to help us enforce these guidelines. If you see content that violates our policies, please report it using the in-app reporting tools.
